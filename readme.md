##  How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ynkmfs123/ImageRegistration.git
```

2. Go to the main directory and run the Hourglass_Hardnet_registration.py script to reproduce experiments.

3. Use data in `/data` for quick tests, and view animations in `/video` to see qualitative results.

4. The GRE program depends on essential Python modules stored in the `/modules` directory.
